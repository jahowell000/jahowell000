- 👋 Hi, I’m @jahowell000
- 👀 I’m interested in UX design and standards/best practices for design in digital and digital/physical hybrid spaces. Oh and a bit of UI coding. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Figma, ML, AI, and musical production.
- 💞️ I’m not yet looking to collaborate as I need to observe and learn first.
- 📫 Reach me at jahowell.design@gmail.com
